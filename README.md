# fix-errors

`fix-errors` is a fun, lighthearted CLI tool to "fix" all your (fictional) errors with a bit of humor. Play around with different flags and try to reduce errors to zero!

## Installation

You can run this package directly with `npx`:

```bash
npx fix-errors
```

## Usage

Run `fix-errors` to start the fun! You’ll see animations and messages indicating the progress of "fixing" errors. Your goal is to reach zero errors by using various flags and experimenting with different approaches.

## Flags

- `--all`: Attempt to fix all errors in one go.
- `--verbose`: Show more detailed information during the fixing process.
- `--silent`: Suppress most output.
- `--unfixable`: Try to fix “unfixable” errors for an extra challenge.
- `--hint`: Get a playful hint on how to reduce errors.

_(More flags may be added as the project evolves!)_

## Game Mechanics

Errors are categorized by types like **fixable**, **unfixable**, **critical**, **major**, **minor**, and others. Each type responds differently to the flags, adding a puzzle element to reaching zero errors. The error count persists across sessions, so you can track your progress over time. Errors reset periodically, adding a fresh challenge each day!
